This is the KDNA Audioplayer made by me. 

It is important to know that it has been made by C# on Arch Linux

Problems:

//Slider ain't working. It moves, but you cannot seek in each musics.
//You can only listen to one music. 

Working:
//It works basically. It is using free and open-source vlclib
//It is opening up by using dotnet run. Either way it is using .NET 7.0
//PLAY-STOP-PAUSE-OPEN buttons are working fine.
//Visualizer also working pretty fine, reacting good on which button has been used.
